> *A powerful Hyprland config with a simplistic, modular structure.*

**⚠️ Heads up:** This is *my* config and therefore it will work best on systems similar to mine. While I do try hard to make this config as hardware / software agnostic as possible, there may be some parts you will have to configure yourself.

## Dependencies

### Fedora

```sh
swaylock-effects \
hyprland-git \
xsettingsd \
alacritty \
fastfetch \
playerctl \
wlogout \
waybar \
mako \
wofi \
```

The following dependencies can be found on Copr:  
[`Hyprland-git`](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kasion/Hyprland-gi)
